# FeedForward Neural Network
Implementation of a FeedForward Neural Network (FFNN) using Matlab. The network is trained using Gradient Descent combined with the BackPropagation technique, and its performances can be evaluated on two datasets, namely the Monk dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MONK's+Problems) and a sensor data dataset.
